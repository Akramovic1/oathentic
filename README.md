# Oathentic - A Web3 Social Media Platform

Oathentic is a cutting-edge social media platform that blends the purchasing of NFTs (tickets, memberships, art, and coupons) with user-generated content, including **verified reviews** tied to assets in users' wallets.
## Key Features

### 1. **NFT Purchases & Engagement**
- **Seamless Integration**: Users can browse their social feed while purchasing NFTs directly. These NFTs include event tickets, memberships, art, and consumer coupons.
- **Interactive Content**: Users can engage with NFTs and share experiences related to the assets they hold, such as event attendance or redeemed coupons.

### 2. **Verified Reviews**
- **Authenticity Through NFTs**: Reviews are directly tied to NFTs or POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) in users' wallets. This guarantees that only verified buyers can provide reviews, ensuring the authenticity of the feedback for events, activities, or purchases.
- **Trusted Ecosystem**: This feature resolves the prevalent issue of false reviews by allowing only legitimate participants to rate their experiences.

### 3. **User-Generated Content**
- **Content Creation**: Beyond NFT purchases, users can post content, share updates, and participate in discussions, further enhancing the social experience on the platform.
- **Verified Participation**: Content and reviews are tied to user activity, whether they are event attendees, coupon redeemers, or art collectors.

### 4. **Onboarding to Web3**
- **Custodial Wallet**: Oathentic offers users a **custodial wallet** option, allowing seamless onboarding to the Web3 ecosystem for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology.
- **User-Friendly**: The custodial wallet makes it easy for new users to enter the blockchain world without needing to manage private keys or understand complex crypto concepts.

## The Problem Oathentic Solves

### 1. **Authenticity of Reviews**
In the events, activities, and consumer coupon sectors, one major issue is the reliability of user reviews. Oathentic solves this problem by ensuring that reviews are linked to assets in users' wallets. This means that only those who actually purchased or redeemed NFTs related to an event or product can write a review, making the feedback more trustworthy.

### 2. **Customer Engagement**
Oathentic uses NFTs and POAPs to **engage and re-engage** with customers. By analyzing usersâ€™ onchain activities and interests, businesses can send **airdrops** or tailor rewards based on the assets in the users' wallets. This creates personalized offers and experiences, deepening the relationship between brands and consumers.

## Re-Engagement with Airdrops and Rewards
- **Personalized Engagement**: By leveraging user data such as redeemed NFTs and POAPs, businesses can create personalized campaigns to engage users with rewards, airdrops, or exclusive offers.
- **Targeted Communication**: This approach ensures that businesses reach users who have demonstrated genuine interest in their products, increasing the likelihood of user retention.
